<p>Hi, gandaaa. It‚Äôs finally here ‚Äî your birthday! (But technically‚Ä¶ our birthday. üòù)</p>
<p>Before you go off and celebrate, I hope you take a moment to read this letter. I just want to share a few things from my heart.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Birthday to the most beautiful girl I know ‚Äî inside and out.</strong></p>
<p>All I can say is that you did great‚Ä¶ no, not just great ‚Äî you did your best this past year. And that alone makes me so proud of you.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen how much you‚Äôve grown, even in ways you don‚Äôt notice. I wish for you to become even stronger, to be better than who you were yesterday, and to keep going ‚Äî even when things get tough. Because I believe in you. Always.</p>
<p>I just want you to enjoy your day... stress-free and full of laughter and happiness. And I want you to know how much I love you.</p>
<p>This letter is just a small gift for your truly special day. I really hope you‚Äôll love it. I know it‚Äôs not much, but let me tell you... one day, when I can, I‚Äôll give you something even more special ‚Äî maybe even those handmade flowers you truly deserve.</p>
<p><strong>I know others have given you more, but no one will give you something this pure.</strong></p>
<p>I still can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve reached this point ‚Äî celebrating our birthday together. And if you‚Äôre ever wondering what gift to give me... your presence is more than enough to make me happy on our special day.</p>
<p>I wish for you to always be well ‚Äî to be healthy and strong. So strong that even negative thoughts would say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get through her mind.‚Äù</p>
<p>I have no other wish but for you to succeed. And honestly, I don‚Äôt usually pray for anything ‚Äî but for you, I always will. Not for myself... but for you. Because without you, I feel like I‚Äôm nothing.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre the reason I strive to be better. You‚Äôre the reason I study harder. You‚Äôre the reason I keep fighting ‚Äî even on days I feel like giving up.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm proud of how far we‚Äôve come ‚Äî how we‚Äôve learned to open up without fear. From the moment you let me in, I‚Äôve grown so much because of you.</p>
<p>Maybe sometimes, you wonder if I‚Äôm just good at first ‚Äî like the others you‚Äôve met. But let me assure you: you don‚Äôt have to think that way anymore.</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt make promises ‚Äî because I know how much you hate them. Instead, I‚Äôm here to prove to you that <strong>real and unconditional love exists.</strong> It exists in the real world ‚Äî just like in the movies you love. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs sincere, and always open to growth.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for all the times you treated me ‚Äî for all the food you bought, and the little things you gave without ever keeping score. To be honest, I feel a bit embarrassed sometimes, because I don‚Äôt have much to offer in return. But you never made me feel that way. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never forget. And when I‚Äôm able to, I‚Äôll make sure to give back in my own way.</p>
<p><strong>Special mention to your beauty ‚Äî one that no one else could ever compare to.</strong> (I know you‚Äôd probably hate that I‚Äôm saying this üòù) But really‚Ä¶ just tell me all your insecurities, and I‚Äôll love and admire every single one. Your insecurities are exactly what make you beautifully you. And I‚Äôll always be here to remind you of that. Whatever you think is ugly about yourself‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what makes me love you even more.</p>
<p>Happiness fills me every time I realize... me?? Having a chance with you?! It feels like I‚Äôve been blessed by the heavens ‚Äî like I did something supernaturally kind for the world to deserve someone like you. It‚Äôs like a dream having you by my side. Others would envy me just for standing next to you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wonder if I even deserve you ‚Äî you‚Äôre too pure, too beautiful, too good to be mine. You‚Äôre so much better than me. I don‚Äôt even know why you chose me... But I‚Äôm beyond grateful that you did.</p>
<p>You turned my world ‚Äî once filled with emptiness ‚Äî into a place I could never imagine. Even angels would be jealous if they knew the kind of love you‚Äôve made me feel.</p>
<p>And lastly, I wish for both of us to be happy ‚Äî and to keep improving. I‚Äôm always here for you. <strong>To be your kakampi sa lahat.</strong> No matter where you are, I‚Äôm always sending you my full love and support.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also here to give you the father figure you‚Äôve always needed ‚Äî because I know how deeply you‚Äôve craved the validation you didn‚Äôt get when you were young.</p>
<p>I may not be the best at giving gifts. I may not be able to give you the things you love, or anything fancy. But I hope this letter is enough to put a smile on your face.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Birthday, and I love you always ‚Äî Ionah Chris Andoy.</strong></p>
